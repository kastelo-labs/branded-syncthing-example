# Branded Syncthing example

This repo shows how to create a Docker image that overrides parts of the
Syncthing GUI for branding purposes.

## Overrides

The original GUI source is available in
https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/tree/main/gui. Use this as a guide to
the existing assets that you might want to override. In this example we're
making a couple of smaller changes:

- We replace the blue Syncthing logo with an orange Kastelo logo. The logo
  is served from `default/assets/img/logo-horizontal.svg` so we override
  that path with another file in SVG format.

- We replace `default/assets/css/theme.css` to change the default font to
  Comic Sans.

Other customizations are also possible, for example it might be an idea to
add vendor metadata to the Docker image itself to differentiate it from the
original.

```
# Set image metadata as required
LABEL org.label-schema.vendor "Kastelo USA, Inc."
LABEL org.label-schema.url "https://kastelo.net/"
```


## Build and test

Create a branded Docker image and run it:

```
% docker build -t my-org/branded-syncthing:latest .
% docker run -it --rm -p 8384:8384 my-org/branded-syncthing:latest
```

Visit the GUI to observe the changes.

The Syncthing version is a build arg (defaulting to `latest`), so you can be
specific when building for reproducibility:

```
% docker build --build-arg SYNCTHING_VERSION=1.23.6 -t my-org/branded-syncthing:1.23.6 .
```
